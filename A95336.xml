            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas a Letter of <hi>John Perrots</hi> from <hi>Jamaica</hi> to <hi>Mary Booth, John Coopland, Margaret BradiÅ¿h</hi> and <hi>Francis Walker,</hi> bearing date the <hi>12th.</hi> of the <hi>4th.</hi> Moneth 1665. was produced by <hi>Robert Cobbet</hi> to <hi>Morgan Watkins</hi> in favour to <hi>John Perrot</hi> or intentionally for the clearing of the Å¿aid <hi>John</hi> from Å¿uch things as had been reported of him or charged againÅ¿t him to be inconÅ¿iÅ¿tant with Truth, and contrary to the leadings and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings of the Principles and Å¿pirit of Truth, which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and which he profeÅ¿Å¿ed though afterwards he apoÅ¿tatized or departed therefrom to hide himÅ¿elf under the Earth, or diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear as in reÅ¿pect of the Lord and his Truth; Å¿o that the Å¿aid Letter by <hi>Robert Cobbet</hi> produced as aforeÅ¿aid doth not Å¿erve to the uÅ¿e, intent, and purpoÅ¿e for which it was produced, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confirme and make good Å¿uch things as were reported of the Å¿aid <hi>John,</hi> or charged againÅ¿t him to be inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with Truth, and contrary to the dealings of God and the experiences of his Å¿ervants and meÅ¿Å¿engers whom he hath Å¿ent forth to declare and manifeÅ¿t truth unto many, who have in love received the Å¿ame, and do manifeÅ¿t their faithfulneÅ¿s unto God by continuing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in under the GoÅ¿pel DiÅ¿penÅ¿ation.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, The Å¿aid <hi>John Perrot</hi> (in that Letter) Å¿aid, Children I never told you otherwiÅ¿e at any time, and now tell you again weeping, that I never deemed my Å¿elf to be more then a man of Infirmity; if he was infirme in his judgment, councel, principles, doctrine, impoÅ¿itions, and practiÅ¿es, then he was unÅ¿ound in the bottome or root of the matter, and contrary to the Å¿pirit and mind of ChriÅ¿t JeÅ¿us, and therefore no fellow labourer with God in the work of the MiniÅ¿try; for they who are acquainted with God, and have received the Å¿pirit and power of God as the true GoÅ¿pel MiniÅ¿ters do, and aforetime did, to enable them to be as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172969:3"/>
workers together with him in their MiniÅ¿tration received of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. who hath made them able MiniÅ¿ters of the New TeÅ¿tament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5, 6. enabling them for his own Å¿ervice that they are as workers together with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. In all things approving themÅ¿elves as the MiniÅ¿ters of God, their Å¿ufficiency is of him; but they who Å¿peak of themÅ¿elves and act from their own wiÅ¿dom and reaÅ¿on, and the mans part only, and not from the Å¿pirit and power of God, are no more indeed then men of Infirmity as in reÅ¿pect of their MiniÅ¿tration; And if <hi>John</hi> was any thing more then a man of Infirmity, and if he was not unÅ¿ound and infirme upon the aforeÅ¿aid conÅ¿ideration, why Å¿hould he have made mention of it upon the account that he hath done, Å¿eeing he hath Å¿o much cryed down man, and would have man to be nothing, but the Lord to be all, who is not unÅ¿ound or infirme in any thing, if <hi>John</hi> was no more but a man of Infirmity then he Å¿poke of himÅ¿elf, and his Å¿peaking, Å¿tanding, and acting was of himÅ¿elf, and Å¿o his Natural parts and abilities were his Å¿ufficiency, therefore it was of Å¿elf and not of the Lord; and Å¿elf Å¿ufficiency we deny as inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with Truth, in reÅ¿pect of the MiniÅ¿try, and acknowledge to the Lord and his power to be our Å¿ufficiency, not that we are Å¿ufficient of our Å¿elves to think any thing as of our Å¿elves, but our Å¿ufficiency is of God, who alÅ¿o hath made us able MiniÅ¿ters of the New TeÅ¿tament.</p>
            <p>And whereas he (in that Letter) Å¿aid unto them (by way of accuÅ¿ation of others) whilÅ¿t many have come forth in fury as an HoÅ¿t of armed Men with InÅ¿truments of War in attempts and purÅ¿uits to Å¿lay me, yet are they no more in mine eye then as Children labouring to beat the air. Whereby it appears that <hi>John</hi> in his own account hath not been hurt, nor at all harmed by them that he hath Å¿o falÅ¿ly accuÅ¿ed, who deny that they have gone forth in any fury as an hoÅ¿t of armed Men in purÅ¿uites with InÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of War to Å¿lay him, neither could he prove it, who turned falÅ¿e accuÅ¿er of the brethren, and that is the work of old AntichriÅ¿t and for joyning with him therein, he might expect a reward from the hand of the Lord according to his doings. And whereas he Å¿aid many are Å¿triving in an evil day. That may Å¿tand for himÅ¿elf and thoÅ¿e that Å¿trives on his behalf by an evil Å¿pirit to Å¿ow the feed of diÅ¿Å¿ention, and lead people into a Å¿eparation from that which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172969:3"/>
God leadeth into: And that indeed is an evil work which he and others were Å¿triving to accompliÅ¿h, but the Lord is blaÅ¿ting and will Å¿poil their AntichriÅ¿tian deÅ¿ign.</p>
            <p>And whereas in that Letter he Å¿aid unto them it Å¿hall go well with you and me if we all keep in the root of their matter, and in it be hid under the Earth till the winter is paÅ¿t and gone, is not that to make no appearance for God, neither in meeting or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, or any thing elÅ¿e that may expoÅ¿e them to Å¿ufferings for RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s Å¿ake, if Å¿o, is not that an AntichriÅ¿tian trick of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and altogether inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with Truth. And did not <hi>John</hi> lead you to forÅ¿ake the practiÅ¿e and teÅ¿timony of Truth, and center under the Earth in the root of deceit, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds unÅ¿oundneÅ¿s and infirmity in Councel, Doctrine, Judgment and PractiÅ¿e, which is nought in the foundation thereof, and root of the matter, and what was amiÅ¿s and nought in the foundation could never be made good by <hi>John</hi>'s confirmation. And if by the root of the matter be meant the principle of Truth, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift or Talent, which God hath committed to any for his own uÅ¿e and Å¿ervice to beget and gather to the brightneÅ¿s of his riÅ¿ings, that is neither to be hid in the Earth, nor laid up in a Napkin untill troubles, trials, afflictions, and perÅ¿ecutions for RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s Å¿ake (which may be accounted the Winter) be paÅ¿t and gone: Therefore <hi>John</hi>'s judgment and councel in the caÅ¿e was unÅ¿ound and infirme, and of the mans part in him, which as he himÅ¿elf accounted was never otherwiÅ¿e; therefore inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with Truth, and not according to the direction, judgment and councel of the Å¿pirit and power of God (in man) which is Å¿ound and firme, or elÅ¿e it would Å¿ignifie nothing for a Å¿ouls inÅ¿truction, confirmation, Å¿atisfaction and conÅ¿olation. And that Å¿pirit which leads people who have received any heavenly gift or talent from God wherein they have appeared in principle and practiÅ¿e on the behalf of the Lord, to hide the Å¿ame under the Earth again, Å¿o as to diÅ¿appear in reÅ¿pect of the work of the Lord by hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves under the Earth, and Å¿o lie hid in obÅ¿curity for their Å¿elf Å¿afely untill troubles, trials, afflictions, and perÅ¿ecutions ceaÅ¿e and be gone, is not the Å¿pirit that we have received of God, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Å¿pirit, as <hi>John Perrots</hi> was, which we have already denyed, and by the truth it's condemned, for they who hide themÅ¿elves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172969:4"/>
under the Earth as <hi>John</hi> adviÅ¿ed to do, are covered with Earth and deceit, and not with the Å¿pirit and power of truth, and the woe againÅ¿t them is already pronounced, for woe unto them that cover with a covering, but not of my Å¿pirit, Å¿aith the Lord: And it's very evident and plain unto us that <hi>John Perrot</hi> was as that branch (he Å¿poke of) which hath Å¿triven to bud out of its natural Å¿eaÅ¿on, and that is the cauÅ¿e his bloÅ¿Å¿omes did fall, and its boughs wither according to his own reaÅ¿on.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>John Perrot</hi> in that Letter Å¿aid, I was once a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ter of Truth and RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s amongÅ¿t you and many others, and was faithful in what I did, though Å¿omethings of the MyÅ¿tery of the GoÅ¿pel could not be borne of my Elders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> What is that to the purpoÅ¿e if he was once a MiniÅ¿ter of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s or numbred amongÅ¿t them that are Å¿o, Å¿eeing that by tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion he fell from it, and turned down under the Earth to hide himÅ¿elf there, and turned enemy to them who are MiniÅ¿ters of RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and in preaching the Word are inÅ¿tant both in Å¿eaÅ¿on and out of Å¿eaÅ¿on according to the charge given before the Lord; he is no more to be accounted of: <hi>Judas</hi> was once num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred amongÅ¿t the ApoÅ¿tles of our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, and had received part of the MiniÅ¿try and ApoÅ¿tleÅ¿hip, <note place="margin">Act. 1. 16, 17, 20.</note> but he afterwards by tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion fell from it, and his end was miÅ¿erable, and he no more accounted of but <note place="margin">Act 1. 23, 24. 25. 26</note> as a Traytor and an ApoÅ¿tate; however that part of the MiniÅ¿try and ApoÅ¿tleÅ¿hip which he fell from, was deÅ¿irable and prayed for, Å¿o that truth is truth, though Å¿ome may betray their truÅ¿t and depart or fall from it, and it will outlive all deceit and ApoÅ¿tates; and as for thoÅ¿e things of the MyÅ¿tery of the GoÅ¿pel he Å¿poke of, which he Å¿aid could not be borne by his Elders, what were they but Å¿uch things as tended to faction, as teaching people to be irreverent in keeping on their Hats at Prayer: And foraÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he acknowledged Elders he Å¿hould have kept in a place of Å¿ubjection, and not have preÅ¿umed to impoÅ¿e things upon them, for the Lord hath required that the Younger do Å¿ubmit to the Elder; and what is it that maketh true ElderÅ¿hip but the eternal Spirit and power of Truth, that doth open the myÅ¿tery unto them to whom its given to know the MyÅ¿teries of the Kingdom: And how durÅ¿t <hi>John</hi> riÅ¿e up in falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ations and judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:172969:4"/>
them as he hath done, did not that beÅ¿peak great pride in his heart, and that he aÅ¿pired to be great in a Å¿elf exaltation, and now the Lord hath abaÅ¿ed him for Å¿o doing.</p>
            <p>And whereas he Å¿aid, I am not provoked unto haÅ¿t Å¿eeing all times will have their Revolution, and I wait untill a change cometh, and a renewed commiÅ¿Å¿ion is given from above, that if I Å¿ound the Trump of the Lord it Å¿hall not be at uncertainty.</p>

               <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> It Å¿eems that what he Å¿aid then and before was but at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, and he was no MiniÅ¿ter of Truth and RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s then in his own account, nor in the account of <hi>Robert Cobbet,</hi> who confeÅ¿Å¿ed that he had jealouÅ¿ies of <hi>John Perrot</hi> before us, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter jealouÅ¿ies then we had, and Å¿aid he was then no MiniÅ¿ter, for his commiÅ¿Å¿ion was ended, what change was it that <hi>John</hi> waited for to Å¿ee come, was it to Å¿ee perÅ¿ecutions and afflictions over and be gone; and what commiÅ¿Å¿ion was it he waited for Å¿eeing that he hath formerly Å¿aid that pleading the cauÅ¿e that is truly righteous, and bearing his teÅ¿timony of the power of love was finiÅ¿hed, and if that was finiÅ¿hed as he Å¿aid it was, would he have had a commiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion to plead the cauÅ¿e that is unrighteous, and to bear teÅ¿timony againÅ¿t the power of love; if Å¿o, he might expect that from old AntichriÅ¿t, for the Lord would never grant him any Å¿uch, and becauÅ¿e he hath rejected the Lord in rejecting his Councel, he was rejected of God Å¿o as to be any MiniÅ¿ter of his.</p>
            <p>And whereas (in the Letter aforeÅ¿aid) he Å¿aid to <hi>Mary Booth,</hi> In reading thy particular lines I find that thy love would have me become yet again very honourable in <hi>IÅ¿rael.</hi> Seeing he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>Mary Booths</hi> love in wiÅ¿hing his ReÅ¿toration from that which renders him diÅ¿honourable in <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> ought not he to have accepted her love Å¿o as to have Å¿ought to return to that which in her apprehenÅ¿ion he was fallen from, for it appeared that both in her and his own accompt he was degenerated and fallen from what he once either really was, or at leaÅ¿t was by them apprehended Å¿o to be, for <hi>Robert Cobbet</hi> Å¿uÅ¿pected <hi>John,</hi> and had jealouÅ¿ies of him, before he Å¿o fell; And when that he was fallen the love of <hi>Mary Booth</hi> in wiÅ¿hing that he might become once again very honourable in <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> beÅ¿poke in her mind unto others that he was fallen from that which in her account once made him honourable in <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> and that he was then diÅ¿honourable therein, or amongÅ¿t them; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:172969:5"/>
her love deÅ¿iring that he might become once again very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> beÅ¿poke that he Å¿tood in need of a ReÅ¿toration unto that which he had loÅ¿t by degeneration, which thing he told her he Å¿ought not, having once Å¿een the great evil and Å¿nare that hath attended Å¿uch a condition, both as touching what it might prove to others and to himÅ¿elf; and for that cauÅ¿e (he Å¿aid) it was beÅ¿t to him to be the moÅ¿t contemptible, and it was with him at that preÅ¿ent to walk and live both in reÅ¿pect of judgment and fellowÅ¿hip void of the appearance of having it with any Creature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> Whereby it appeared that an honorable eÅ¿tate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> was not in his account to be Å¿ought or deÅ¿ired after, becauÅ¿e it might be attended with danger, thereby beÅ¿peaking diÅ¿truÅ¿t in his mind, as if God could not preÅ¿erve out of the Å¿nare. 2. That it was better for him to be in that which made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, then in that which makes honorable in <hi>IÅ¿rael;</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> was contemptible enough, when by tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion he was fallen from what he received, as in reÅ¿pect of the MiniÅ¿try, the which if he had abode in, might have made him honorable, doth it therefore follow that becauÅ¿e <hi>Judas</hi> might have been honorable if he had abode in the MiniÅ¿try received, but being attended with temptations departed from the Lord, and by tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion fell from his MiniÅ¿try, (and into compliance with the Å¿pirit of the World, and Å¿o became contemptible and a Å¿tink to this day, as Å¿uch are and will be who depart from the truth, and walk in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> way of ApoÅ¿tacy) that therefore the way of the Lord, and the work of the MiniÅ¿try, is not to be deÅ¿ired and if any fall from it that its beÅ¿t for them to be contemptible in not Å¿eeking or endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a ReÅ¿toration, if the love of the Lord thorough any deÅ¿ire it, or if the Lord call thereunto. And thirdly, that in reÅ¿pect of judgment, and fellowÅ¿hip he Å¿aid he did walk, and live void of the appearance of having it with any Creature, and did Å¿tand Å¿till for a Å¿eaÅ¿on as one dumb and mute, looking round about him to Å¿ee which way the world mans mind would roul, which is not Å¿ound Doctrine, for God is Light, and they that walk in the Light as he is in the Light they have fellowÅ¿hip one with another, who would therefore have depended upon <hi>John Perrot,</hi> except Å¿uch as declined in their hearts from the Lord, and incline to the world, and are

Å¿eeking an occaÅ¿ion to forÅ¿ake the truth and break off from the way of the Lord, whoÅ¿e minds are preparing for RanteriÅ¿me, and to walk in the way of Å¿eparation from God and his People, by following a Å¿pirit of deluÅ¿ion, to turn unto any thing that Å¿uites with a fleÅ¿hly communion according to the worldly imaginations, under pretence of liberty in a myÅ¿tery which is not bounded by the Å¿pirit of truth and holineÅ¿s, and let them take heed leaÅ¿t the Å¿pirit of deluÅ¿ion which entred <hi>John</hi> do enter them, Å¿o as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to center in RantiÅ¿me: for he Å¿aid, Children be not offended if I ask Å¿omething that the light in you may in due time anÅ¿wer you, did God by his light in us draw us from any thing of appearance, or the formal cuÅ¿tomes outward which are not of worÅ¿hip in themÅ¿elves, but through the croÅ¿s which Å¿tood againÅ¿t our carnal affections in them things, and now if we are naturalized to a cuÅ¿tome which the natural affection taketh part of, is not the croÅ¿s to be to that, and would it not be now a croÅ¿s to us to do thoÅ¿e things which were never Å¿in Å¿imply in themÅ¿elves, which once through the croÅ¿s we were led from, conÅ¿ider all manner of geÅ¿tures, Å¿alutations, and external, formal appearances for the great myÅ¿tery of the GoÅ¿pel, and RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, thereof is held in the croÅ¿s, which touching many things no man can meaÅ¿ure in another.</p>
            <p>What's that to the purpoÅ¿e if no man can meaÅ¿ure Å¿uch things the Å¿pirit of God in man, and the true meaÅ¿uring time can meaÅ¿ure theÅ¿e things in all that appertain to the GoÅ¿pel, and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouÅ¿neÅ¿s thereof. Therefore it was deceit in <hi>John</hi> that Å¿o Å¿poke, and made the aforeÅ¿aid inquiry whereby they might if they were not blinded in their underÅ¿tandings Å¿ee how the old ranting Å¿pirit was making way for its deÅ¿ign, and how the Serpent is <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

As God by the Light of ChriÅ¿t in us hath led us in the CroÅ¿s to our wills to keep on our Hats and not put them off in reÅ¿pect of honouring Mens perÅ¿ons, he will not by the Å¿ame light and Å¿pirit lead us to put them off again upon the Å¿ame conÅ¿ideration: 3. As God hath led us by the light of ChriÅ¿t in us to aÅ¿Å¿emble and meet together to wait upon him in the way of his worÅ¿hip in the croÅ¿s to our wills, he will never by the Å¿ame light and Å¿pirit of grace lead us from the continuation of that godly practice, though we be affected with the Å¿ame, becauÅ¿e of his preÅ¿ence with us who doth enjoyne his People to continue therein; for it is the duty of the People of God to continue in

Lord leadeth his People into, and enjoynes them to continue and abide therein, under his own Å¿piritual and heavenly diÅ¿penÅ¿ation.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Iohn</hi> Å¿aid, that the <hi>MyÅ¿tery</hi> of the GoÅ¿pel and the RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s thereof is held in the CroÅ¿s, and Å¿aid keep to your own, and Å¿ee that for ConÅ¿cience Å¿ake ye have no more reÅ¿pect (through any cuÅ¿tome, form of greeting or Å¿alutation) to pleaÅ¿e one Å¿ort of People paÅ¿Å¿ing only under one denomination, then caution in your hearts by Å¿uch cuÅ¿tome to diÅ¿pleaÅ¿e others of other denominations, and if that offend man you are to bear the CroÅ¿s, which the <hi>Iewes</hi> would naile you unto.</p>
            <p>If by the <hi>Iewes</hi> he did mean and intend good ancient old friends who continue and abide in the Truth, as his Writing imports; and if by nailing them to the CroÅ¿s (who are given to change their Principles and Practices as he did) be to fix and faÅ¿ten them to the power of Truth, or MyÅ¿tery of the GoÅ¿pel, and the RighteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s thereof, (which is held in the CroÅ¿s that they may continue and abide in the Å¿ame, be the nailing of them thereto that he Å¿poke of, that they may not run into deluÅ¿ions and turn from the Truth to conforme unto and comply with all Å¿orts of People under eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry denomination in that which the Spirit and power of Truth doth not allow of and own, wherein are they to be blamed? for Å¿o fixing and faÅ¿ting them to the Truth for their eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment, confirmation and continuation therein? But if by the <hi>Iewes</hi> he did mean the enemies of ChriÅ¿t, and accounted good friends to be Å¿uch; and if by the nailing of them to the CroÅ¿s be to expoÅ¿e them to Å¿ufferings for RighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did ChriÅ¿t by nailing him to the CroÅ¿s; he was greatly miÅ¿taken, and did falÅ¿ly accuÅ¿e the brethren, and ran himÅ¿elf into confuÅ¿ion and Å¿elf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and Å¿o was enÅ¿nared by the words of his mouth; and if all Å¿orts of People under every denomination, who have an outward profeÅ¿Å¿ion of GodlineÅ¿s muÅ¿t be conformed unto and complyed with in Å¿uch manner of geÅ¿tures, Å¿alutations, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, formal appearances for the pleaÅ¿ing of them in that and thoÅ¿e things which the light and Å¿pirit of God doth not allow of nor own where is the CroÅ¿s taken up and Å¿tood in, to thoÅ¿e things, for as the light of ChriÅ¿t doth diÅ¿cover the evil and croÅ¿s the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affections when they would run out into Å¿uch actions as the truth doth condemn, Å¿o they who forÅ¿ake that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Lord leadeth

into, they run in their own will, and carnal affections into that which the World's fellow Å¿hip Å¿tands in, whereby they go through their fleÅ¿hly wiÅ¿dom and natural affection to croÅ¿s the Light and Spirit of the Lord, and Å¿o they forÅ¿ake the true CroÅ¿s, which is of power to crucifie them to the World, and the World unto them; and that's the cauÅ¿e why the enmity remains, and a life is pleaded for and Å¿ought after, which the Å¿pirit and power of Truth doth condemn. And whereas <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> in that Letter hath Å¿aid my heart meditates the thing that is juÅ¿t and equal among all, but can hardly yet come to this very rule, becauÅ¿e of preÅ¿ent evil in me, which I cannot eÅ¿cape, which is of having a greater reÅ¿pect in the general of the Å¿atisfaction of <hi>Quakers</hi> in me rather then others, but this muÅ¿t be overcome, and I wait for it, though none have perÅ¿ecuted me as <hi>Quakers</hi> have done.</p>
            <p>It Å¿eems <hi>Iohn</hi> had not then wholly and altogether gotten into a perfect Å¿tate of RantiÅ¿me becauÅ¿e he had not altogether Å¿lain the witneÅ¿s and got over the Å¿ame, Å¿o as to conforme unto and run into any thing that truth doth not own, &amp; account it no Å¿in, for it Å¿eems the witneÅ¿s in him that did bear witneÅ¿s unto the People of God, reproachfully called <hi>Quakers,</hi> was not wholly overcome in him at that time, becauÅ¿e he could not but have a greater reÅ¿pect in him to them then unto others, but he accounted it an evil in him to have a reÅ¿pect to the <hi>Quakers</hi> more then to others, &amp; he expected to overcome that, and waited for it; who was turned to be a falÅ¿e accuÅ¿er of them, for he Å¿aid he never was Å¿o perÅ¿ecuted by any as by them; whereby it appears that he never was perÅ¿ecuted to do him any harme, neither hath he been in any wiÅ¿e wronged or hurt by them; for he hath falÅ¿ly accuÅ¿ed the brethren in that thing, and hath before cleared them from the force of the Å¿aid falÅ¿e accuÅ¿ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confeÅ¿Å¿ing in effect that they never did him any harme: But however the Innocent People of God reproachfully called <hi>Quakers</hi> are clcar from his AÅ¿perÅ¿ions, and do deny all perÅ¿ecutions, and he alÅ¿o hath cleared them whom he hath Å¿o unjuÅ¿tly accuÅ¿ed by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that they have done him no harme as aforeÅ¿aid.</p>
            <p>And as for that unity he Å¿poke of or having unity with candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of heart of <hi>Iohn Swinton</hi> in a paper of his lately given forth to <hi>IÅ¿rael;</hi> he hath Å¿o much the more diÅ¿covered and manifeÅ¿ted his Å¿pirit in oppoÅ¿ition to friends; and <hi>Iohn Swinton</hi> may take
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:172969:8"/>
notice what Å¿pirits they are whom he hath Å¿o gratified by his paper as aforeÅ¿aid: But it's certainly true that offences muÅ¿t come, and the Woe is pronounced from God againÅ¿t them by whom they do come. And it's certainly true that the enemy did heretofore enter <hi>Iohn Perrot,</hi> and made uÅ¿e of him as an InÅ¿trument, to offend many of the little ones that believes in the Lord JeÅ¿us, and to cauÅ¿e the way of Truth to be evil Å¿poken of, and he might expect to bear the diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure of the Lord for Å¿o doing; and as for <hi>Iohn Swinton</hi> in what he hath written againÅ¿t Friends the Lord doth not own it, for it did not proceed from his own power and Å¿pirit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the witneÅ¿s of God in his People do deny it, and it cannot be received into the Å¿pirit and power of Truth, becauÅ¿e it proceeded not from it, Å¿o that he hath not the anÅ¿wer of God in the hearts of his People for its acceptation, but is teÅ¿tified againÅ¿t, becauÅ¿e it is for condemnation; therefore <hi>Iohn Swinton</hi> had better never have writen the Å¿ame, but it may be a warning to him for the time to come to take heed how he preÅ¿umes to do any Å¿uch thing.</p>
            <p>And as for the ground and cauÅ¿e of <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> forÅ¿aking his MiniÅ¿try, he Å¿aid, he had cauÅ¿e as well natural in Manhood and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection to his Wife and Children, as Å¿piritual in obedience to that life which drew him for example Å¿ake to labour in his proper Å¿tation. It Å¿eems his ground was firÅ¿t earthly, and proceeded from a Natural cauÅ¿e, that was the firÅ¿t motive to lay down his MiniÅ¿try, <hi>viz.</hi> in reÅ¿pect of his Wife and Children, not conÅ¿idering that they who have received a MiniÅ¿try from God are to continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Lord in their MiniÅ¿tration, and in preaching the Word, to be inÅ¿tant in Å¿eaÅ¿on and out of Å¿eaÅ¿on, notwithÅ¿tanding Wife and Children; for ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿aid he that loves any thing more then me is not worthy of me; and that which a man moÅ¿t loves that he is moÅ¿t conÅ¿tant unto, and can do the moÅ¿t for, and do it moÅ¿t freely. And as for the Å¿econd cauÅ¿e, it was but a pretence and meer deceit, as if God Å¿hould give a MiniÅ¿try to one, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards lead him from it again to be covered over with earth as an example to others, which is contrary to the truth, and to the command of the Å¿pirit of ChriÅ¿t in the true GoÅ¿pel MiniÅ¿ters, who Å¿aid walk as ye have us for Examples. And they did not do as <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> did, for if he Å¿hould have been followed as an example, then all the MiniÅ¿ters of the GoÅ¿pel of ChriÅ¿t might forÅ¿ake their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:172969:8"/>
MiniÅ¿try according to <hi>John</hi>'s account, and turn into the Earthly Imployments, and lie hid under the Earth, and no more appear for the Lord and his Truth; Å¿o that it appears his MiniÅ¿try Å¿tood in his own will to diÅ¿penÅ¿e with, and now he is laid aÅ¿ide as one uÅ¿eleÅ¿s. And whereas he Å¿aid, he could not bear; that the GoÅ¿pel Å¿hould be chargable on his part, but was willing to lay forth his all for the glory of Gods Å¿ake that was concerned therein. That's but deceit that Å¿poke in him, for who hath been chargable like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him upon that conÅ¿ideration, and then he had forÅ¿aken that which he made Å¿o chargable to his Å¿hame and confuÅ¿ion, and is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the Earth again, which is his proper Å¿tation or place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Å¿aying. And as for <hi>Iohn Harwood, Iohn White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houÅ¿e,</hi> and <hi>Dorothy White,</hi> they are denyed, diÅ¿owned, and judged by <hi>Robert Cobbet</hi> as he hath acknowledged to Å¿ome of us; and we do deny them to be of us, and hereby declare that we do not own them but do teÅ¿tifie againÅ¿t them, and all Å¿uch factious Å¿pirits.</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> in that Letter from <hi>Iamaica</hi> Å¿aid, he was toÅ¿Å¿ed on every hand yet not moved by any. If he was not moved by any, hath he not hereby contradicted them who Å¿ay that Friends drove him from the Truth, to drive a man from the Truth is to move him, but Friends did not drive him from the Truth; and <hi>Iohn</hi> in effect hath cleared them from Å¿uch an aÅ¿perÅ¿ion; Å¿aying, though he was toÅ¿Å¿ed on every hand, yet not moved by any; if not moved by any then not removed or driven from the Truth by Friends; therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> in effect hath cleared them from the force of Å¿uch an accuÅ¿ation or charge as aforeÅ¿aid. And whereas <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> Å¿aid in that Letter, I am given to be this day the reproach of many. Who hath given him to be Å¿o? did he not give himÅ¿elf unto the deluÅ¿ions of Satan to be an occaÅ¿ion of the reproach of many? and who are they that he was a reproach unto? a reproach he was, and one that was given, to change both MiniÅ¿try, Doctrine and practiÅ¿e, which God hath led his People into, and enjoyned them to continue in, and not do as <hi>Iohn</hi> did, (and thoÅ¿e that followed him for their example) have done; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath been a reproach to the truth, &amp; to them that keep their firÅ¿t love, who abide in the Covenant of Grace, and he might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hamed of his doings, and Å¿o may all they who joyned with him in that and thoÅ¿e things that tends to deviÅ¿ion and Å¿eparation from God and his Truth, and to bring a reproach upon them who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue

and abide in the Principles, Doctrines, practice and power of God received.
